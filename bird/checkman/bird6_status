description:
 This check monitors the overall state of BIRD.

 This check needs the agent plugin {"bird"} to be installed.
 
 This check can go WARN or CRIT when BIRD is not running (CRIT),
 when BIRD is shutting down (CRIT),
 when reconfiguration is in progress (WARN),
 when BIRD is in graceful restart recovery mode (WARN),
 when the uptime of the daemon is below a configurable threshold (WARN),
 when a configuration file has been modified since the last reconfiguration (WARN).
 
 For the last reconfiguration warning the modification time of the following files is relevant:
 {/etc/bird(|6).*}
 {/etc/bird/bird(|6).*}

inventory:
 The inventory automatically creates a service.

perfdata:
 {"uptime"}: Uptime of the process in seconds.
 
 {"time_since_last_reconfiguration"}: Time since last reconfiguration in seconds.

parameters (dict): This check uses a dictionary as parameter. The dictionary can have
                   the following keys:

                   {"uptime_low_threshold"} - An integer (seconds) specifying the threshold for the low uptime warning.
                        The default is 300 seconds.

                   {"config_file_min_age"} - An integer (seconds) specifying the minimum age of a config file required to trigger a last reconfiguration warning.
                        The default is 60 seconds.
